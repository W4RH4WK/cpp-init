# Opinions

**Trigger warning:** this documents contains my personal opinions.
Take everything here with a grain of salt and feel free to disagree!
Your milage may vary.

## `struct` vs. `class`

There's hardly any difference whether you use the keyword `struct` or `class` for defining a type.
My rule of thumb is to use `class` when the type has non-public members, or special copy / move semantics.
The keywords `protected`, `private`, `delete` are good indicators for using `class`.

Also, put the `public` part first, then `protected`, then `private`.

## Member function vs. regular function

Often you have the choice of implementing something as a member function or a regular function.
My rule of thumb is to create a member function whenever the functionality is related **primarily** to **one instance** of the type (e.g. `Vector2::length`)
If the implementation primarily deals with 2 (or more) instances of the same type, I prefer a regular function (e.g. `lerp` for `Vector2`).

Sometimes I opt for a static member function instead of a regular function when having the typename as prefix for the function call increases readability.
Consider `Vector2::dot` vs. just `dot`.

A common alternative to my rule of thumb is to focus on the public interface of a type.
If some functionality can be implemented by using just the public interface of a type, implement that functionality as a regular function.

## Naming conventions

In C++ we have a bunch of different naming conventions.
Chances are that you'll be either working on a personal project where it doesn't matter which convention you use, or you'll be working on an existing project where you have to adhere to whatever is already used.
Anyway, here are my personal preferences in case you are interested:

- Use *camel-case* as default (e.g. `configFile`, `loadConfig`)
- Capitalize constants, enum members, types, type parameters, concepts, and namespaces (e.g. `ConfigManager`, `ConfigPath`)
- Use *all-caps* for defines / macros along with a project specific prefix (e.g. `ANKER_DEBUG_BREAK`)
- Function names should start with a verb as they *do* something (e.g. `loadConfig`)
- Add adjectives to variables to convey additional information (e.g. `activeUser` instead of `user`)

Certain identifiers are prefixed to make their *impact* easily recognizable in code:
- Prefix global variables with `g_`
- Prefix non-public member variables with `m_`
- Prefix static member variables with `sm_`
- Prefix interface types with `I` (e.g. `IAudioServer`)

File names do not use upper-case letters to avoid issues with Windows being case-insensitive.
Consider [Canonical Project Structure](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html).

## Compile times ain't the issue

Suffering from long compile-times?
Use pre-compiled headers and avoid unnecessary uses of templates.

For reference, the source code for [The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138610/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_through_Daybreak/) is around 1M lines of modern C++ code. The game code + engine code + dependencies compile on my AMD Ryzen 9 7950X in around 30 seconds â€” no cache, with optimizations enabled.
Recompilation, when changing only a single translation unit, is typically under 2 seconds.

I therefore believe that long compile times are not inherent to using C++.

## Build systems suck

Yes, they do.
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) sucks, [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) maybe a bit less.
However, even CMake sucks less than ruling your own, custom build system because most C++ programmers and maintainers know the oddities and issues of CMake.
People don't have any experience with your custom build system and don't know about its pitfalls and surprising behavior.

> Better the devil you know than the one you don't.

## Dependency management sucks

To be fair, I do like that not every C++ projects comes with a million third-party dependencies like your typical JavaScript project.
But granted, given how many basic use-cases are not covered by the standard library, it's hard to go without any third-party library.

While [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) and [Conan](https://conan.io/) are the go-to package managers for C++ nowadays, I've encountered issues with both of them.
Most specifically it is a hassle to develop a patch for one of your dependencies and have your project use the modified dependency instead of the original version (see [Conan#13743](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/13743#issuecomment-1794414576) for reference).

My current approach, as stupid as it sounds, is to include the sources of third-party dependencies along with the project (i.e. vendoring) and compile them along with the project using custom build instructions.
This works surprisingly well for most dependencies and allows me to define exactly how the dependencies are built.
A major downside of this approach is that you have no way to upgrade a dependency automatically, rendering this approach impractical for security critical projects.
For dependencies that are super complicated to build, I build them separately with the original build system and add the build outputs to my project.

I may come back to vcpkg and Conan at some point in the future though.

## The standard library sucks

Well, that depends, but yes, some parts are certainly problematic.
Still, it's a better idea to pick the parts that do work than completely ruling your own.
Like with build systems, most C++ programmers are aware of the standard library's features and shortcomings.
And chances are pretty high that your custom re-implementation will have similar, or even worse, shortcomings thanks to C++ being such a complex language.

So, unless you have a *really* good point not to use the standard library, just use the standard library!

## Modules are dead on arrival

C++ modules were standardized with the C++20 standard.
3 years later, C++ modules are still not usable in general; many third-party libraries don't provide them and even compiler support is incomplete.

Also, at this point I don't entirely understand what's the point:

- Compile times are not really an issue as outlined above.
- Preprocessor macros leaking from third-party headers is annoying but we've been dealing with that for decades now.
  Prefixing macros with a project specific identifier is an adequate solution.
    - Client code that is macro dependent (e.g. code using win32 API) still needs these macros, C++ modules can't change that.
    - Certain operations still cannot be implemented in the base language, but require the use of macros (e.g. [TRY](https://boostorg.github.io/outcome/tutorial/essential/result/try.html)).
- Module names are not coupled to namespaces like it's done in most other languages.
- Modules are completely unrelated to any form of dependency management or packaging structure.
- An internal (i.e. un-exported) type can be exposed by an exported function.
  [In Rust, this is an error.](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=5561de88a30de336b6727bd15497645a)

Overall, modules appear to just add a ton of complexity to the C++ infrastructure (compilers, IDEs, package managers, etc.) without solving a real issue.
